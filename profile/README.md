# NIPSCERN

**NIPSCERN** is a research and development organization working in collaboration with **CERN**, with a focus on High Energy Physics, scientific computing, and high-performance systems.

Our main work includes the development of **software, architectures, and research support tools**, such as:

- Institutional website: **nipscern.com**
- **YANC** compilers
- **AURORA** interface and development environment
- **POLARIS** graphical interface for SAPHO
- **SAPHO** – *Scalable Processor for Hardware Optimization*
- **CGV-WEB** – web-based calorimeter event viewer
- Technical and scientific documentation

Although many of our projects are software-based, our activities extend beyond software development, encompassing research, system architecture, educational tools, and support for scientific experimentation.

We actively involve **undergraduate students**, who contribute directly to research projects in **High Energy Physics** in collaboration with CERN.
