**NIPSCERN** is a research and development organization based at the **Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF), Brazil**, working in collaboration with **CERN**.  
Our activities focus on **High Energy Physics**, **scientific computing**, and **high-performance hardware and software systems**.

Our work spans the design and development of **software platforms, processor architectures, graphical interfaces, and research support tools**, including:

- **NIPSCERNWEB** – Institutional website: **nipscern.com**
- **SAPHO** – *Scalable Architecture Processor for Hardware Optimization*
- **YANC** compilers and language tools
- **POLARIS** – graphical interface for SAPHO
- **CGV-WEB** – web-based calorimeter event viewer
- **AURORA** – integrated development environment
- Technical and scientific documentation

Although many of our projects are software-centric, **NIPSCERN’s scope goes beyond software development**.  
We are actively involved in **system architecture design, hardware–software co-design, educational tools, and computational support for scientific experiments**.

A key aspect of NIPSCERN is the **direct involvement of undergraduate students**, who contribute to real research projects in **High Energy Physics** and scientific computing, in collaboration with **CERN** and its experiments.

Our mission is to integrate engineering, software development, particle physics, art and logic into the creation of concrete tools, architectures, and systems that support scientific research and experimentation.
